- zork-like navigation with physical locations, interaction with objects
- uniform acccess to kb/filesystem/email/graphdb with gui, cui (console ui), wui (virtualworld ui?)
- each node can have different (single/multiple) views
- toggle doc vs grid/table vs tree/outline views of same data
- use tree or tags for navigating
- image viewer/tagger
- modular - backend datasource plugins, different frontends, plugins for different view types
- text editor view with powerful abilities - edit list of objects as one text file, switch to spreadsheet view, sort, link, jump, wiki
- cloud db like firestore as another datasource - could host certain objects online to publish or share with others? [paid]
- be able to handle tripplanner ui? maybe extend that as poc to get funding? ehh rather start fresh
